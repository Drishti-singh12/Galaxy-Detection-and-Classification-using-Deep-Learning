# Galaxy-Detection-and-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
To evaluate the performance of our proposed solution on the Galaxy 10 dataset, I have used the pre-trained ResNet50 model and applied the Feature Extraction method of Transfer Learning. 
Proposed solution using Deep learning techniques has shown promising results in Detecting and Classifying Galaxies according to their morphology into 10 different classes.
